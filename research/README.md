# Research

This directory is the workspace for active research and experimentation.

## Contents

- **Pipeline Runners**: Scripts like `run_phase1.py`, `run_phase2.py` etc., which orchestrate the ML pipeline steps.
- **Pine Scripts**: `pine/` contains TradingView Pine Script prototypes.
- **Experiments**: Ad-hoc analysis scripts.

## Workflow

1.  Run `run_phase1.py` to generate the Event Catalog.
2.  Run subsequent phases to enrich and analyze data.
3.  Results are stored in `output/` and reports in `reports/`.
